## Technologies

### Framework

The project is built using Django Rest Framework (DRF) as the primary framework.

### Database

The application uses PostgreSQL as the database backend.

### Third-Party Libraries

- **Django Rest Framework:** Used for building the RESTful API endpoints.
- **Django Rest Framework Simple JWT:** Used for JWT-based authentication.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python (3.9 and above)
- PostgreSQL (15 and above)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
    cd your-project
    ```

2. Creating and activating virtual environment:

    ```bash
    pip install pipenv
    pipenv shell
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pipenv install
    ```

### Running the Application

1. Apply database migrations:

    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

2. Create a superuser (if applicable):

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

3. Run the development server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

The application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Running Tests
